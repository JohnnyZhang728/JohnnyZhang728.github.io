• Story Synopsis: On a rainy evening in 2050, programmer Ma Fei meets a young girl and offers to walk her home under his umbrella. Although the journey isn't long, they take a roundabout route, deliberately extending their time together. Along the way, they talk about many things, moving from strangers to close confidants. They even start filming a movie on a pier. But all good times must come to an end, and the two eventually reach the point of parting ways. Just as they are about to say goodbye, Ma Fei makes a startling discovery about the girl's hidden identity... Is it deception or betrayal? Should he forgive or understand? The city, crafted by technology, seems almost alive, breathing in rhythm. What are the owls flying everywhere? Faced with choices, what decisions will Ma Fei and the girl ultimately make? <br>
