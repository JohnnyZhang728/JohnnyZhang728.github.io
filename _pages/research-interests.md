Overview
======
My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary research that blends art and technology. Specifically, I am interested in exploring AI and HCI applications in film, theater, media, and performance. Storytelling is at the core of my interests, and I am enthusiastic to utilize VR/AR/MR to enhance creative expression. My goal is to utilize technologies to enable the design of immersive & interactive experiences and foster user-centered approaches.

To be more specific, I aim to:
1. Explore and develop experimental environments/user interfaces/tools for artists, filmmakers, and theater creators to facilitate their creative processes more efficiently and effectively, enabling them to produce finer and more sophisticated works.
2. Create interactive and immersive experiences by leveraging VR/AR/MR and AI to promote storytelling in film, theater, and other art forms, crafting compelling narratives and enhancing audience engagement.
