Hi! My name is Zeyu ZHANG. Currently, I work as a remote research intern at TAMU under the supervision of Prof. [Wai Tong](https://wtong2017.github.io/). I'm looking for Ph.D. position starting in 2025 Fall.

I completed my Master of Science in Computer Science at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) in Dec. 2023. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in 2022. 

From Oct. 2023 to Aug.2024, I was a Research Assistant at HKU Metaverse Innovation Lab under the supervision of Dr. [Loretta Choi](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~ykchoi/). 

You can find my CV here: [Zeyu Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Zeyu_ZHANG_CV.pdf). You can find my Artwork Portfolio here: [Zeyu Zhang's Artwork Portfolio](../assets/Portfolio_Zeyu_ZHANG.pdf). I am eager to collaborate, and if you find that we share common interests, please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:zeyu2022@connect.hku.hk).

My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary research that blends art and technology. Specifically, I am interested in exploring AI and HCI applications in film, theater, media, and performance. Storytelling is at the core of my interests, and I am enthusiastic to utilize VR/AR/MR to enhance creative expression. My goal is to utilize technologies to enable the design of immersive & interactive experiences and foster user-centered approaches. 

To be more specific, I aim to:
1. Explore and develop experimental environments/user interfaces/tools for artists, filmmakers, and theater creators to facilitate their creative processes more efficiently and effectively, enabling them to produce finer and more sophisticated works.
2. Create interactive and immersive experiences by leveraging VR/AR/MR and AI to promote storytelling in film, theater, and other art forms, crafting compelling narratives and enhancing audience engagement.
