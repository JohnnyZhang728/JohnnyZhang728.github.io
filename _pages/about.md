Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) under the supervision of Prof. [Anyi Rao](https://anyirao.com/) and Prof. [Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org/). I pursue my Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Film Studies at the [Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies](https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/). <br>

My research interest focuses on AI for Film. To be more specific, I aim to:

* Infuse cinematic aesthetic, director intention, and narrative meaning into generative AI models.
* Develop agentic AI systems specifically for high-quality film production.
* Inherit and evolve classical film theories (Montage Theory, Realist Film Theory, and Film Semiotics) within the context of AI creation, using them to drive, inspire, and guide technological innovation.

My vision is to advance the field of AI-for-Film by pushing the frontiers of core AI technology. <br>
I am eager to collaborate, and if you find that we share common interests, please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:zeyu.zhang@connect.ust.hk).
